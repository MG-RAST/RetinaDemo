<h1>RetinaDemo</h1>

<p>The RetinaDemo repository holds demonstration widgets and rendereres implemented with the Retina framework. Standalone applications should go into their own repository. General use widgets and renderers should be placed into the base Retina repository.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>To use, fork this repository and clone to your desktop. The module contains the Retina repository as a submodule. Once you cloned your fork you must do:</p>

<pre>
> git submodule init
> git submodule update --remote
</pre>

<p>That will get you the latest Retina code. To view the available widgets and renderers, open index.html in your web-browser.</p>
